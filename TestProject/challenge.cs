            You've been asked to add a feature to your company's software.
            The feature is intended to improve the renewal rate of subscriptions to the software.
            Your task is to display a renewal message when a user logs into the software system and is notified their subscription will soon end.
            You'll need to add a couple of decision statements to properly add branching logic to the application to satisfy the requirements.
