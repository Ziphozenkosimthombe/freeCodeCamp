/*
- developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of grades
- for each student in a class.
-  The parameter for application.

1. start with four Students. Each student has five exam scores.
2. Each exam score is an integer value, 0-100. where 100 represents 100% correct.
3. A student's overall exam score is the average of their five exam scores.
4. A student's letter grade is determined by the following table:
    - 90-100: A
    - 80-89: B
    - 70-79: C
    - 60-69: D
    - 0-59: F
5. Criteria for extra credit assignments:
    - Include extra credit assignment scores in the student's scores array.
    - Extra credit assignments are worth 10% of an exam score (when calculating the final numeric grade)
    - Add extra credit assignment scores to the student's total exam score before calculating the final numeric grade.

6.application needs to automatically assign letter grades based on the calculated final score for each student.
7. application needs to output/display each studentâ€™s name and formatted grade.
8. application needs to support adding other students and scores with minimal impact to the code.
